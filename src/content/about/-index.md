  title: Imagine - The Grid Visibility Manifesto
  description: "Paradigm Shifting GridVisibility - About us and the outcome of working with US. Rapid, low-latency feedback tranforms. Why is this paradigm shifting and what does that mean. People are making decisions today based on inhereted constraints. Can't imagine unlimited bandwidth that is ubiquitous, available, accessible, etc. Just imagine how you can transformt he monitoring and mangement of the grid. Imagine a constant grid signal for VPP, DR, etc. Join us... We're more than 1-minute data. I've never seen. I didn't think this was possible. Continuous Point on Wave, NOT snippets. Note 2 - 3 seconds of an event. Let's look 5 minutes before...because we can. We're always there. That's the essence of the change we are bringing to the industry. Let us show you. GridVisibility harnesses the broadband industry’s existing communication network assets to solve one of THE biggest grid challenges today - how to provide real-time awareness of the state of the distribution grid, cost efficiently, rapidly and at scale...now."
