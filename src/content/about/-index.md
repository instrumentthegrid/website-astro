about:
  title: Just Imagine...
  description: "Imagine how different grid monitoring and management would be if today’s bandwidth constraints didn’t exist. Imagine a high fidelity, low latency, and continuous point-on-wave grid signal with unlimited bandwidth…all the time…everywhere. Not one-minute data, but millisecond data. Not three second event snippets, but on-demand raw data from any point in time.
  Unconstrained grid data would change everything! It exists today."
