about:
  title: Just Imagine...
  description: "Imagine how different grid monitoring and management would be if today’s constraints didn’t exist. Imagine a high fidelity, low latency, and continuous point-on-wave grid signal with unlimited bandwidth…all the time…everywhere. Not one-minute data, but millisecond data. Not three second event snippets, but on demand raw data as far back as you want to go. Imagine looking five minutes before an event because you have a hunch there is pattern?
  It would change EVERYTHING! And you don't have to imagine it, because it exists today."
