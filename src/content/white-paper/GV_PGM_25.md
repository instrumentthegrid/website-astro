##### Summary

This paper explores the cable industry's experience in deploying DOCSIS® cable modems (CMs) to enable two-way broadband internet access, the development of the PNM program (a necessary outgrowth of that deployment), and how this can inform distribution grid operators to achieve their own equivalent Proactive Grid Maintenance (PGM). This research and development of PNM were conducted through CableLabs®, the industry's premier R&D laboratory, and its cable operator members.

##### Abstract

While there are fundamental differences between distribution grid operators and cable operators, there are significant similarities as well. The distribution grid is undergoing a similar transition today that cable networks underwent several decades ago. That being a transition from one way delivery of services to residences and businesses to dynamic, two-way services (data or energy flowing in both directions). What can the utilities learn from the cable industry to speed its transformation? This paper explores these similarities and how the cable industry’s Proactive Network Maintenance (PNM) program can be used as a model for a similar Proactive Grid Maintenance (PGM) approach for the distribution grid. PNM has had a dramatic impact on the reliability of the cable network and a corresponding reduction in operational expenses for cable operators. This paper shows how the same model can be cost efficiently adopted by distribution grid operators to achieve similar benefits.
