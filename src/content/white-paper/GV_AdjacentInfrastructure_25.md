## Summary

The purpose of this paper is to present the current context of the grid and how harnessing the existing adjacent broadband infrastructure can rapidly and cost effectively advance Grid Modernization nationally at scale.

#### Abstract

The need for grid modernization is well recognized and
well documented, particularly in the US Department of Energy
Grid Modernization Initiative’s recently published Grid
Modernization Strategy 2024. What is less well recognized,
potentially in the context of Infrastructure Modernization, is the opportunity to leverage the existing adjacent broadband infrastructure to rapidly advance grid modernization and address some of the key attributes and objectives that have been identified in the DOE Grid Modernization strategy 2024.
