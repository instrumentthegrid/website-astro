## Summary

<b>Assessment of GVP Technology:</b> GVP is a high-resolution, time-synchronized data platform that uses broadband-connected sensors to track the availability and stability of the power grid. <b>The technology presents a viable solution to improving situational awareness, transmission planning, and operational decision-making.</b> To achieve these benefits, VELCO and its partners can focus efforts on applying GVP for specific value-add use cases, collaborate openly, and increase the scale and functionality of the technology over time.

#### Abstract

Vermont, like many states, is experiencing a rapid transformation of its energy landscape. The rise of distributed energy resources (DERs), electric vehicles (EVs), virtual power plants (VPPs), and other grid-edge technologies is creating exciting opportunities, but also presents new challenges. One key area Vermont Electric Power Company (VELCO) and Vermont Electric Cooperative (VEC) are focusing on is improving visibility into the interactions between transmission and distribution systems. While this has been a challenge due to historically fragmented data, we are actively exploring innovative solutions to gain a more holistic view. This enhanced visibility is crucial for ensuring the continued reliability and high quality of transmission service as we integrate these new technologies and build a more resilient and sustainable energy future for Vermont...
