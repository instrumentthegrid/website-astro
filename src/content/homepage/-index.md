  - title: Cost & Time Efficient With Rapid Speed-to-Value. 
    description: Harnessing existing broadband infrastructure enables rapid and cost-effective deployment at scale. Our GVP "blue box" provides continuous point-on-wave monitoring at 10,000 samples per second, with .5 microsecond time stamps. With a 15-minute broadband UPS retrofit, we realize a rapid time-to-data. We're not limited by bandwidth because we employ the $2 trillion broadband investment already made.

  - title: Reliable, Resilient, Secure & Independent. 
    description:  Our broadband collaborators built and maintain the most sophisticated and secure communication networks on the planet. That means our solution is reliable, resilient (4+ hr battery-backed), secure (Global Fortune 50 security-by-design), and out-of-band (utility agnostic). Our GridVisibility Platform's unique technical and business characteristics reduce utility risk and create previously impossible value streams.

  - title: Frictionless Deployment & Implementation.
    description: GridVisibility coordinates the entire process. No electric utility field crews or IT involvement required. Provisioning time is 15 minutes per sensor. Today, the coexistent broadband infrastructure touches 90% of US households and businesses, enabling rapid deployment at scale. GridVisibility provides continuous awareness of grid conditions and behaviors in weeks...not years.

  - title: We Are Proven & Ready to Scale. We're a Startup That's Not a Startup.
    description: GridVisibility is strategically aligned with the largest broadband operators in the world. Eight years of R&D incubation within <u><a href='https://www.cablelabs.com' target='_blank'>CableLabs</a></u>, a strong balance sheet, combined with successful lighthouse deployments and collaborators, means we're not just another startup. We're a game changer.

# Integrate
# integrate:
#   title: Supplement the Tools Your Teams Already Use.
#   content: We built our flexible web interface and API-native solution to augment and support all current grid data, monitoring, and operational applications. However, we're also developing and supporting completely new analytic and continuous insight and integration paradigms. Because we've already "done the impossible", we must support both the "current" and "next generation" grid monitoring and management paths.
