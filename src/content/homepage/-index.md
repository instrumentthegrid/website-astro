  - title: Cost & Time Efficient w/ Rapid Speed-to-Value. 
    description: Harnessing existing broadband infrastructure enables rapid, cost-effective deployment at scale. Our GVP "Blue Box" provides continuous point-on-wave monitoring at 10,000 samples/second through a 15-minute broadband node retrofit. We're not limited by bandwidth, because we harness the $2 trillion communications investment already made.

  - title: Reliable, Resilient, Secure & Independent. 
    description:  Our broadband partners built and maintain the most sophisticated and secure communication networks on the planet. That means our solution is reliable, resilient (4+ hr battery-backed), secure (Global Fortune 50 security-by-design), and out-of-band (utility agnostic). Our GVP Platform's unique technical and business characteristics both reduce utility risk and create previously impossible value streams.

  - title: Frictionless Deployment & Implementation.
    description: GridVisibility coordinates entire process. No electric utility field crew or IT involvement w/ 15min/sensor provisioning. The coexistent broadband infrastructure already overlaps with 90% of US power grid, enabling rapid deployment at scale. GridVisibility provides continuous awareness of grid conditions and behaviors in weeks...not years.

  - title: We Are Proven & Ready to Scale. We're a Startup That's Not a Startup.
    description: When you're strategically aligned with the largest broadband operators in the world, you've done something right. Eight years of R&D incubation within CableLabs, a strong balance sheet, an established and growing financing network, combined with successful lighthouse deployments and partners, means we're not just another startup...we're game changers.

# Integrate
# integrate:
#   title: Supplement the Tools Your Teams Already Use.
#   content: We built our flexible web interface and API-native solution to augment and support all current grid data, monitoring, and operational applications. However, we're also developing and supporting completely new analytic and continuous insight and integration paradigms. Because we've already "done the impossible", we must support both the "current" and "next generation" grid monitoring and management paths.
