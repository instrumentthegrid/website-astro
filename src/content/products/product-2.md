title: "The New Distribution Grid Paradigm"
description: "Inverter-based Resources (IBRs), along with other distributed assets at the grid edge, now have a material impact on distribution operations, planning, and reliability. Current grid monitoring options are hindered by insufficient communications, vendor and integration complexity, lack of actionable insights, high costs, low speed, and inability to scale. Grivisibility solves these challenges through their novel approach to providing unprecedented situational awareness across the distribution grid. The GridVisibility Platform (GVP) enables frequency & voltage detection & alerts, fault analysis & FLISR applications, IBR ride through performance analysis, & much more."

  title: "Rapid Impact: Time-to-insight in weeks, not years."
  content: "GridVisibility harnessess the existing broadband communications infrastructure, so our grid sensors come online immediately upon installation by a broadband technician. GridVisibility clients start seeing and analyzing continuous distribution grid data in as little as six weeks. With an average installation time of 15 minutes per sensor, scaled deployments happen in weeks, not years. A wide range of utility distribution operations and professionals can leverage the GVP platform for their specific needs and use cases. GVP's user-designed web interface, ad hoc data downloads, and API-native data delivery capabilities enable every type of workflow integration."

Whether arcing faults, equipment-related faults, or transients, the GVP tool captures the raw data, as it happens, ties those event to the topology - substation, feeder, phase - and then represents those data/events geospatially via Google Maps. GVP identifies, logs, alerts, and then visualizes and analyzes the data upon request, at whatever timeframe and fidelity the user requests."
