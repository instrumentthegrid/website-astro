title: "The New Distribution Grid Paradigm"
description: "Inverter-based Resources (IBRs), along with other distributed assets at the grid edge, now have a material impact on distribution operations, planning, and reliability. Current grid monitoring options are hindered by insufficient communications, vendor and integration complexity, lack of actionable insights, high costs, low speed, and inability to scale. Grivisibility solves these challenges through their novel approach to providing unprecedented situational awareness across the distribution grid. The GridVisibility Platform (GVP) enables frequency & voltage detection & alerts, fault analysis & FLISR applications, IBR ride through performance analysis, & much more."

  content : "The distribution grid today is designed to react in seconds, but with increased adoption of IBRs, controlled by power electronics, orchestration requires millisecond awareness. GridVisibility enables low latency, reliable, resilient, and continuous monitoring of distribution grid state, including frequency and voltage, along with their rates of change, faults, transients, and more."

    - "/images/products/GV_WebsitePics_Waveform2.png"
    description : "With unprecedented fidelity, GridVisibility uncovers arcing faults, equipment-related faults, or transients. The GridVisibility Platform ties raw sensor data to the grid topology - substation, feeder, phase - and then represents those data/events geospatially via Google Maps. GVP identifies, logs, alerts, and supports visual analytics, including playback, threshold analysis, and fault location solutions, like SoftStuf's Wavewin application."

    slider_images:
    - "/images/services/GV_WebsitePics_WaveForm1.png"
    description : "Beyond FERC 901 compliance, utilities dealing with high IBR penetration need enhanced visibility to monitor IBR operations during a myriad of grid disturbances. GridVisibility is a critical tool for validating IBR performance and response during grid voltage and frequency deviations, supporting a more stable and reliable grid."

    - "/images/products/AdvancedAnalysis_Low.jpg"
    description : "To address power quality, harmonics, and oscillation issues, arising from IBRs and large loads (like data centers), high fidelity waveform data is essential. Further, GridVisibility’s .5 microsecond accuracy time synchronization enables the identification of correlative behaviors across feeders and phases."

    description : "GridVisibility provides ground truth for the topology configuration. Often, restoration activities impact grid topologies. GVP identifies those changes, such as phase realignment, nominal voltage levels, and can be an invaluable tool in ensuring the quality of grid operating models. Additionally, during grid restoration activities, GridVisibility's resilient architecture continues to monitor the grid, highlighting areas of concern for line crews, and identifying misbehaving inverters and backfeeding."

    description : "The complementary systems that orchestrate modernized electric grids, to ensure grid stability, require new levels of state-of-grid awareness. ADMSs, DERMs, and VPPs benefit from a consistent, out-of-band signal localized to the feeder and phase. Orchestration systems increasingly require a low latency signal that GridVisibility can quickly and cost efficiently provide."
