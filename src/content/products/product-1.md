    NERC provides the guidance for assuring reliability of the grid. Their most recent advisory report is explicit in the need for enhanced visibility of the grid. GridVisibility provides the tools to ensure compliance.



    #### For Transmission Planning

    Transmission Planning increasingly requires insights about distribution grid behaviors to ensure an accurate representation of operational models. GridVisibility provides distribution grid data at whatever fidelity and time scales are required, including voltage, frequency, rate-of-change of volatage (ROCOV), and rate-of-change of frequency (ROCOF)."

    description : "Don't take our word for it though...“Limited visibility of the distribution system beyond the substation, enormous costs to deploy distribution-level monitoring systems including phasor measurements units (PMUs), and the prevalence of DERs and grid-edge technologies in Vermont makes GVP a uniquely effective solution and important long-term partner.” (Elevate Energy Consulting)
